promotional and informational materials not expressly requested. The
website operator reserves the right to take specific legal action if
unsolicited advertising material, such as email spam, is received.</p><p align="center"> <strong>3.

Data collection on our website</strong></p><p> <strong>Cookies</strong></p><p> Some of our web pages use cookies. Cookies do not harm your computer and do
not contain any viruses. Cookies help make our website more user-friendly,
efficient, and secure. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your
computer and saved by your browser.</p><p> Most of the cookies we use are so-called "session cookies." They are
automatically deleted after your visit. Other cookies remain in your
device's memory until you delete them. These cookies make it possible to
recognize your browser when you next visit the site.</p><p> You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so
that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a
cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically
accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to
automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies
may limit the functionality of this website.</p><p> Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to
provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are
stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website
operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an
optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such
as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will
be treated separately in this privacy policy.</p><p> <strong>Server log files</strong></p><p> The website provider automatically collects and stores information that
your browser automatically transmits to us in "server log files". These
are:</p><p> Browser type and browser version</p><p> Operating system used</p><p> Referrer URL</p><p> Host name of the accessing computer</p><p> Time of the server request</p><p> IP address</p><p> These data will not be combined with data from other sources.</p><p> The basis for data processing is Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO, which allows the
processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a
contract.</p><p> <strong>Contact form for Ticketshop-Support and Eventorganizers</strong></p><p> Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data
entered on the form, including the contact details you provide, to answer
your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information
without your permission.</p><p> We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only
with your consent per Art. 6 (1)(a) DSGVO. You may revoke your consent at
any time. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data
processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p><p> We will retain the data you provide on the contact form until you request
its deletion, revoke your consent for its storage, or the purpose for its
storage no longer pertains (e.g. after fulfilling your request). Any
mandatory statutory provisions, especially those regarding mandatory data
retention periods, remain unaffected by this provision.</p><p> <strong>Use of Ticketshops</strong></p><p> If you buy tickets for an event on a subdomain of www.ticket.io, your
details, including the ticket purchaser data ("personal data") provided by
you and, if applicable, participant data will be sent to us for the purpose
of processing your request and then stored by us, processed and used. Your
personal data can then be made accessible by our employees to the relevant
in-house departments and specialist departments. <br> <br> For this we collect at least the following mandatory data: <br> First and Last Name <br> E-mail address <br> Address <br> <br> Depending on the event, the organizer may request further information
relevant to the event visit (such as date of birth, gender or license plate
number) as part of the ticket purchase. <br> <br> The processing of data for the purpose of buying tickets and / or
contacting us is in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a DSGVO based
on your voluntarily granted consent, in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1
sentence 1 lit. b DSGVO for the implementation of pre-contractual measures,
which is based on your request and pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1
lit. f DSGVO. Our legitimate interest can be seen in the processing of the
ticket purchase or answering your request.</p><p> <strong>Registration on this website</strong></p><p> You can register on our website in order to access additional functions

by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p><p> Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies". These are text files that are
stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of the use of the
website by you. The information generated by the cookie about your use of
this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and
stored there.</p><p> Google Analytics cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The
website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to
optimize both its website and its advertising.</p><p> <strong>IP anonymization</strong></p><p> We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP
address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other
parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to
transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP
address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will
use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate
your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to
provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for
the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of
Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.</p><p> <strong>Browser plugin</strong></p><p> You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate
settings in your browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may
mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website.
You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of the
website (incl. your IP address) from being passed to Google, and the
processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the
browser plugin available at the following link: <u> <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"> https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en </a> </u> .</p><p> <u>Objecting to the collection of data</u></p><p> You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking
on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent your data
from being collected on future visits to this site: <u> <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"> https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en </a> </u> .</p><p> For more information about how Google Analytics handles user data, see
Google's privacy policy: <u> <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"> https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en </a> </u> .</p><p> <u>Outsourced data processing</u></p><p> We have entered into an agreement with Google for the outsourcing of our
data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the German
data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p><p> <strong>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</strong></p><p> This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program
from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043,
United States ("Google").</p><p> As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you
click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set.
Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your
computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal
identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the
website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell
that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.</p><p> Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot
be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information
obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion
statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion
tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their
ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However,
advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally
identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can
opt-out of this by easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie
by changing your browser settings. In doing so, you will not be included in
the conversion tracking statistics.</p><p> Conversion cookies are stored based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website
operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize
both its website and its advertising.</p><p> For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking,
see the Google Privacy Policy: <u> <a href="https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"> https://www.google.de/policies/privacy/ </a> </u> .</p><p> You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so
that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a
cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically
accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to
automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies
may limit the functionality of this website.</p><p> <strong>Google reCAPTCHA</strong></p><p> We use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") on our websites. This
service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain
View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").</p><p> reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as
on a contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program.
To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on
various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the
website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates
various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the
website, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during
the analysis will be forwarded to Google.</p><p> The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website
visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place.</p><p> Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has
a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated
crawling and spam.</p><p> For more information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google's privacy policy,
please visit the following links: <u> <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"> https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/ </a> </u> and <u> <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"> https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html </a> </u> .</p><p> <strong>Facebook Pixel</strong></p><p> Our website measures conversions using visitor action pixels from Facebook,
Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA
("Facebook").</p><p> These allow the behavior of site visitors to be tracked after they click on
a Facebook ad to reach the provider's website. This allows an analysis of
the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market
research purposes and their future optimization.</p><p> The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we
cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users' identities. However,
the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection
to your Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own advertising
purposes, as stipulated in the <u> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"> Facebook privacy policy </a> </u> . This will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on
third-party sites. We have no control over how this data is used.</p><p> Check out Facebook's privacy policy to learn more about protecting your
privacy: <u> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"> https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/ </a> </u> .</p><p> You can also deactivate the custom audiences remarketing feature in the Ads

You will first need to log into Facebook.</p><p> If you do not have a Facebook account, you can opt out of usage-based
advertising from Facebook on the website of the European Interactive
Digital Advertising Alliance: <u> <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"> http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/ </a> </u> .</p><p align="center"> <strong>7.
